# libpca9685

Driver for the NXP Semiconductors PCA9685 16-channel 12-bit PWM I2C-bus LED Controller ([datasheet](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9685/tree/master/docs/PCA9685.pdf))

## Features

- Tests with [greatest](https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest) and [theft](https://github.com/silentbicycle/theft)
- Bring your own I2C and hardware interface libraries
- Minimal dependencies

## Goals

- Strict, full implementation of manufacturer specifications
- A clean, user-friendly interface for application developers and library writers
- No tight coupling to a specific I2C library or hardware platform (Linux I2C, various Pi/Arduino libraries, etc.)
- No tight coupling to a specific application (LEDs vs. servos, etc.)
- Modern C (C11) development practices, like unit tests, property-based tests, [modern CMake (3.13)](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/), etc.

## Usage

Example application code might look something like this:

```C
#include "libpca9685.h"

// Application (not library) dependencies
#include "pigpio.h"
#include <zconf.h>

// ALL management of the I2C bus itself is your application's responsibility!
static int pi, handle;

// Set up an I2C reader callback
static uint8_t bus_byte_reader(pca9685_s *driver, uint8_t r) {
    // This is pigpio's function we're wrapping here, but it could be any other library, as well
    int result = i2c_read_byte_data(pi, (uint8_t)handle, r);

    // You can add information to the driver struct's status field if you like
    driver->status = (result == PI_BAD_HANDLE) ? "PI_BAD_HANDLE"
        : (result == PI_BAD_PARAM) ? "PI_BAD_PARAM"
        : (result == PI_I2C_READ_FAILED) ? "PI_I2C_READ_FAILED"
        : "ok";

    return (uint8_t)result;
}

// Set up an I2C writer callback
static uint8_t bus_byte_writer(pca9685_s *driver, uint8_t r, uint8_t d) {
    // This is pigpio's function we're wrapping here, but it could be any other library, as well
    int result = i2c_write_byte_data(pi, (uint8_t)handle, r, d);

    // You can add information to the driver struct's status field if you like
    driver->status = (result == PI_BAD_HANDLE) ? "PI_BAD_HANDLE"
        : (result == PI_BAD_PARAM) ? "PI_BAD_PARAM"
        : (result == PI_I2C_READ_FAILED) ? "PI_I2C_WRITE_FAILED"
        : (result != 0) ? "UNKNOWN ERROR"
        : "ok";

    return (uint8_t)result;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    pi = pigpio_start(NULL, NULL);
    char *pi_status = pi >= 0 ? "ok" : "failed";

    handle = i2c_open(pi, 1, 0x40, 0);
    char *handle_status = (handle == PI_BAD_I2C_BUS) ? "PI_BAD_I2C_BUS"
        : (handle == PI_BAD_I2C_ADDR) ? "PI_BAD_I2C_ADDRESS"
        : (handle == PI_BAD_FLAGS) ? "PI_BAD_FLAGS"
        : (handle == PI_NO_HANDLE) ? "PI_NO_HANDLE"
        : (handle == PI_I2C_OPEN_FAILED) ? "PI_I2C_OPEN_FAILED"
        : (handle >= 0) ? "ok"
        : "UNKNOWN ERROR";

    printf("\nMain\n====\n: %d");
    printf("\nPIGPIO Status: %s", pi_status);
    printf("\nI2C Handle Status: %s\n", handle_status);
    printf("Initializing driver...");

    // Initialize your driver structâ€”also does test read and write operations
    pca9685_s my_driver = pca9685(.bus_reader=bus_byte_reader, .bus_writer=bus_byte_writer);

    printf("%s\n", my_driver.status);

    // Set the chip's frequency to 300Hz
    my_driver.set_frequency(&my_driver, 300);

    // Set up a basic timer for example purposes (10 minutes, in seconds)
    int simple_timer = 600;

    // Flash all LEDs on and off continuously until the timer runs out
    while(simple_timer > 0) {
        my_driver.channel_on(&my_driver, -1);
        sleep(1);
        my_driver.channel_off(&my_driver, -1);
        sleep(1);

        simple_timer--;
    }

    // Do some other stuff here...

    // You can attempt an orderly shutdown
    my_driver.soft_reset(&my_driver);

    // Or maybe just restore all defaults
    my_driver.hard_reset(&my_driver);

    // pigpio-specific...
    int close = i2c_close(pi, (uint)handle);
    char *close_message = (close == PI_BAD_HANDLE) ? "PI_BAD_HANDLE" : "CLOSED";
    printf("\nClose result: %s\n", close_message);

    pigpio_stop(pi);

    if(close == PI_BAD_HANDLE) return 1;

    return 0;
}
```

## Who maintains this library?

This library is maintained by [Minnow](https://minnow.me/), an IoT startup that makes smart food pickup kiosks called pods.

## How do I contribute?

Contributions are welcome! Check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9685/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

## How is this library versioned?

This library follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9685/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
